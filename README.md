There are 2 files and 2 folder in the repo.
Folder name : Vanilla_RNN contains files related to vanilla rnn implementation.
Folder name : VAttention_RNN contains files related to rnn with attention implementation.

Following are the description of Vanilla_RNN folder:

1 downloading_dataset.py  : This file download the dataset required for this assignment.//
2. dataset.py : It contains codes for datapreprocessing//
3. config.py : It contains configuration of the model
4. loader.py : it loads the data file for training and validation.
5. model.py : It contains the model artitechture. (Encoder, Decoder and Seq2Seq)
6. evaluate.py : It evaluate the data from trained model.
7. pred.py : It contains the code for prediction on my test data and saving the Predictions_Vanilla Folder.
8. rnn.py : This file is small demo for the Question 1.
9. sweep.py : This file contains sweep for the training .
